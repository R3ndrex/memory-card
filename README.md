# Pokemon Memory Game

A web-based game inspired by the Pokémon franchise. Pick a unique card in each reshuffle to win the game.

## How to play

Click on a card to start the game. Each time you pick a card, make sure you don’t select the same one twice. Your goal is to click on all unique cards without repeating any. If you accidentally click the same card again, the game resets. You can also adjust the number of cards and restart the game at any time.
